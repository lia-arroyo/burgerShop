A Java program simulating a Burger Shop POS system, using OOP principles. This program is part of my OOP Course Assignment where I had to finish the implementation of an existing application. This includes implementing the following: add item or combo, remove item or combo, clear cart, check for missed combo, calculate waiting time, and confirm order. I obtained a perfect score for it.
